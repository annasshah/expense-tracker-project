#Expense tracker.

Create an application based on MERN stack for the following use cases.

- Users can sign up (first name, last name, email, password), login.

- On the first login user will be required to enter his assets, how much cash he has, how many savings he has and how much money he has in bank account after he can edit these as well.

- Set some predefined categories for expenses i.e Food, Fuel, Bills, Loan Installments, Grocery, Shopping, Transport, Medical, Rent, Family, Gifts etc

- Users will be able to create transactions, required fields are Amount, Category, Description, Paid from (cash, account or savings). If the user does not want to select a category from the ones that are defined, allow the user to enter one of his own. From the next transaction the entered category should be listed in the Select box.

- When a user creates a transaction, subtract the amount from the respective asset and add the transaction in the list.

- Separate the transactions month wise.
